                My name is Cuong Nguyen. I graduated from Augsburg University in 2016 with a double major in Biology
                and
                Psychology. Currently, I work at the University of Minnesota in Housing and Residential Life as an
                Assistant Residence Director.

                I love socializing with others so during my free time, I like to go out with friends. We try new
                restaurants around the cities and try to attend fairs to try new foods. Some of my hobbies are
                cooking,
                collecting watches and FunkoPop figures. Currently, I have around 13 watches and upwards of 80+
                FunkoPop
                figures. I also like to watch cooking videos and trying to recreate the recipes. I recently bought a
                cookbook so I can have a base for some recipes and changing it up to how I like things and hopefully
                will be able to develop some recipes of my own as I learn more.
